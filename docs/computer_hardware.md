if you work with computers you've likely

heard terms like RAM hard drive and

processor mentioned by tech support or

others who are more interested in what

goes on inside of a computer's case if

you've always wondered what the various

components of your computer are for but

I've never really had the time to look

into it then this video is just for you

while each one of these components is

complex enough to spend a lifetime

learning about I'm gonna give a very

broad and general overview a typical

desktop computer comes down to these

seven essential parts case power supply

motherboard CPU RAM hard drive and

graphics cards these are the fundamental

parts of any desktop computer it may

seem daunting at first so let's separate



these into two categories simple ones

and the more complex ones for starters

let's look at the case the case is

nothing more than a big hunk of plastic

that houses everything else some of them

have more or less physical space some of

them have different parts where you can

put screws in or this or that but at the

end of the day all the case really does

is provide a nice enclosed system for

everything else next up we have the

power supply this part of your computer

almost always located on the bottom is

the part that plugs into the wall and

provides all of the other parts with the

electricity needed to do their thing you

can think of it as an extremely advanced

AC adapter the last of the simple parts

to mention is the motherboard the

motherboard is a wide and flat circuit

board that all of the other components

plug into it's the part that lets all of

these components send electrical

currents composing data between each

other well not particularly expensive

the motherboard is arguably the most

important component because without it

you'd have nowhere to put anything else

so that's it for the simple components

now let's move on to the more complex

parts the ones that deal with data the

four main components to keep in mind

here are CPU RAM hard drive and graphics

card now first things first I'm going to

establish some terminology keep in mind

that CPU is also known as the central

processing unit or processor these terms

all refer to the same thing there

clearly interchangeable Ram stands for

random access memory and is often

referred to as just a memory a hard

drive is often referred to as a disk

drive or storage and a graphics card is

also known as a GPU or graphics

processing unit for this explanation

I'll be using the terms CPU Ram hard

drive and graphics card so let's start

with the CPU the CPU is where your

computer does things

it isn't really capable of storing very

much data at all but it's very good at

doing things with data quickly reading

it arranging it doing the type of quick

and massive calculations needed to run

your programs this is where most of your

programs are essentially run from it's

often referred to as the brain of the

computer I personally don't like this

description because really your entire

computer is just a brain it's just the

center part of your computer's brain

basically everything that happens in

your computer goes through your CPU at

some point now let's talk about RAM and

hard drive at the same time because they

have a very unique relationship which is

probably why people often confuse the

two your hard drive is where all of your

data is stored when your computer tells

you you're running low on space it's

because your hard drive is almost full

all of the data that makes up your

videos pictures documents project files

or the 3d worlds and models that make up

a game are all stored here while hard

drives can store lots of data they're

relatively bad at accessing that data

quickly everything is accessed through a

tiny little wire here and because most

hard drives are made up of spinning

disks your hard drive isn't going to be

able to constantly give your CPU the

information it needs to run certain

programs

that's where RAM comes in RAM is another

form of storage it stores the exact same

kind of data as your hard drive but RAM

sacrifices storage space for nearly

instant accessibility unlike your hard

drive which sends all of its data

through a tiny little thin wire your RAM

is arranged in these long fence sticks

that insert into your motherboard

think about a storage unit if you have a

massive warehouse with only a thin

doorway it's gonna be difficult to get

in find what you need and get out if

it's kind of spread all over the place

you'll have to go through a tiny door

but if you have a long wide storage shed

that's got a big massive garage

composing an entire side of it

you won't be able to store as much but

things are significantly easier to get

to typically if your computer has a

thousand gigabytes of storage space in

your hard drive it's likely got about 16

gigabytes worth of RAM here's where you

put the stuff you own but you aren't

currently using and this smaller one is

where you put the stuff that you are

using and need to be able to get in and

out of quickly when you run a program or

a project file your CPU identifies what

parts of data are needed for that

program to run it pulls them from your

hard drive and then it stores them in

your RAM sticks for quick accessibility

this is why when you start a new level

of a game for instance it has to load

anytime you see loading it's loading the

data that composes that level from your

bulky hard drive into your RAM from a

user's perspective just follow this rule

of thumb Ram allows you to run intensive

programs while disk space allows you to

have more of these and programs

installed it also allows you to have

more of the data they're referencing

whether it be pictures videos or mods

and finally we get to the graphics card

with all of the calculations going on in

your computer to turn a bunch of numbers

that basically come down to ones and

zeros into a constantly updated

3-dimensional world the final and most

important and arguably most difficult

step is to display that on your monitor

it's possible for your motherboard to do

this alone but it's not gonna look good

and it's certainly not gonna be able to

do much your graphics card is

essentially an entire computer in and of

itself dedicated to the sole task of

figuring out what pixels need to light

up on your screen in what color and at

what time if you were playing a game

that had a very busy and high texture

world with lots of models and different

angles and colors

your CPU is the thing that creates that

world it knows where the stuff is and it

does so with data that's been stored in

your RAM which was loaded out of your

hard drive but it's your graphics card

that figures out what it's supposed to

look like based on where you're standing

in the world without getting too

off-topic here if you're somebody who

likes math I highly recommend you look

up fast inverse square root which is

directly related to how

three-dimensional worlds calculate

perspectives so that pretty much sums it

up

there are other components worth

mentioning such as cooling systems or

internal wireless cards but really those

are extras so to summarize what I talked

about so far the case stores everything

in a physical box the power supply gives

electricity to what means it the

motherboard is the body that everything

plugs into the CPU does everything Rams

stores data that is needed for quick

access

hard drives store everything that you

have installed and the data that goes

along with those programs well the

graphics card figures out how it's all

supposed to look on your monitor well

thank you very much for watching I hope

I helped and if you have any questions

feel free to leave a comment and I'll do

my best to answer them liking and

subscribing is always a big help and I

plan to put out many more videos

explaining technical concepts such as

this one
